# Hello in my Writeups Repo
I hope you can find all needed writeups many CTFs

Let me introduce CTFs and what is its main purpose in CyberSecurity.

## What's CTF?
CTF stands for Capture The Flag,This is a type of cybersecurity competitions or games with a purpose to locate a particular piece of text called a flag that may be on the server or behind a web page.
Capture The Flag (CTF) competition is simulating the real world scenarios of hacking a remote site or exploiting a vulnerability on a specific application.
There are two common types of CTFs:  Jeopardy and Attack-Defence.

Type 1 => Jeopardy CTF

This type includes problems (challenges) like web, digital forensics, reverse engineering and others. Teams or individuals will gain points for any correct challenge they solve. Points are defined depending on challenges difficulty, challenges labeled as hard will help you to gain more points.


Type 2 => Attack-Defence

Here each team has its network of insecure devices (or just one host). Your staff typically has time to repair the infrastructure, and to fix vulnerabilities.So you will defend your own services for defence points , and hack opponents for getting attack points.


## What is a Flag ? 

A flag is some sort of text/MD5 hash that you submit to CTF portal to get the challenge points.(e.g flag{congr4tz_th!5_!5_fl4g})


## What is a Writeup? 

A writeup is a full documentation on how to solve a certain challenge. Reading writeups will help you to gain more knowledge and enhance your CTF skills.However, make sure to read the writeup only when you are really stuck in solving the challenge. 

## What skills are needed to play CTFs? 

Playing capture the flag (CTF) competitions might need some basic prerequisite skills. 
You will need to have some basic knowledge of networking like subnetting, TCP/IP, routing and similar. Also, it is important to know some linux commands which will help you in using command line tools on kali linux.
In addition to that, basic programming skills are also needed. You might not need to write code in some types of challenges but at least you need to know how to read code and understand it. The most important skill you need to have is to be persistent, you won’t be able to solve challenges from the first day.
You will need to practice days and nights to be able to solve your first group of challenges. So, don’t give up easily and keep trying.
